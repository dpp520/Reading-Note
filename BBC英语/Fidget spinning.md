School playground crazes come and go but the latest collectable toy is proving popular with children and adults alike. My kids have gone mad forthe platsic spinning disc called a fidget spinner and I have to admit, I've become a little addicted too – but why?

Fidget spinners have taken the world by storm. They were originally designed to help kids with conditions like autism deal with stress but they have become a popular toy and they're helping reduce my stress levels too – when there's something on my mind I just spin!

So what's the big deal about these three-pronged pieces of rotating plastic? Well, there are many different designs and colours to collect and then there's the challenge of spinning them, getting the speed up, balancing it on the end of your finger. On video-sharing websites, vloggers have amassed millions of views from performing tricks with their fidget spinners. Richard Gottlieb, founder of US-based consultancy Global Toy Experts, says adults are increasingly turning to fidget toys because, he says, with all the bad news in the world, "it is a good time to be selling something that allows an individual to fidget off some stress – particularly at a time when smoking is looked down on."

For most school children, they've become the latest 'must-have' accessory, although some schools have banned them, saying some are poorly made and can be a distraction for pupils. However, one teacher, Ms Timmons, says that they can aid learning among some children. She says "these fidget toys are one way of allowing them to fidget without the disruption of the tapping pencils or the tapping of feet. It's a much less disruptive way to channel their energies into something else while the teaching is going on."

Fidget spinners join a long and distinguished list of other childhood favourites now living in the teacher's top drawer. It wasn't long ago when our homes and school playgrounds were littered with loom bands as they suddenly became must-have accessories. Billions of them were sold and then made into various forms of rubbery jewellery. One teacher, Guy Tarrant, has confiscated numerous items from children over the years. He says: "There's so much stuff, so many fads and stages. I worked as a supply teacher in over 150 schools so I've probably seen it all."

It's probably fair to say fidget spinners won't always be flavour of the month. Eventually they'll be confined to the bin, to be replaced by a new equally addictive and annoying craze.

学校操场上的狂热来了，但事实 证明，最新的  可收藏玩具在儿童和成人中都很受欢迎。我的孩子  为被称为烦躁不安的平板旋转盘而发疯 ，我不得不承认，我也  上瘾  了，但是为什么呢？

指尖陀螺席卷全球。它们最初旨在帮助患有自闭症等疾病的孩子   处理  压力，  但它们已成为受欢迎的玩具，它们也正在帮助减轻我的压力水平-当我想到某些东西时，我会旋转！

那么， 这些  三叉式 旋转塑料件有什么  大不了的呢？嗯，有许多不同的设计和颜色需要收集，然后面临着旋转，提高速度，在手指末端保持平衡的挑战。在视频共享网站上，视频  记录器 已经吸引了数百万的观看者与他们烦躁不安的人表演技巧。美国咨询公司Global Toy Experts的创始人Richard Gottlieb说，成年人越来越倾向于坐立不安玩具，因为他说，面对世界上所有的坏消息，“现在是出售允许个人购买玩具的好时机。缓解烦恼-尤其是在低头抽烟的时候。”

对于大多数小学生来说，它们已成为最新的“ 必备 ”配件，尽管有些学校禁止了它们，说有些学校做得不好，可能会使学生分心。但是，一位老师Timmons女士说，他们可以帮助一些孩子学习。她说：“这些烦躁不安的玩具是一种让他们烦恼而又不会  破坏  自来水笔或敲打脚的方法。 在教学进行时，这是一种破坏性较小的将能量分配给  其他东西的方法。”

Fidget微调器加入了长长而  杰出 的其他儿时最爱清单，这些清单现在都生活在教师的上层抽屉中。不久前，当我们的房屋和学校操场上布满了  织机带时 ，它们突然变成了必需品。他们出售了数十亿枚，然后制成各种形式的橡胶珠宝。这些年来，一位老师盖伊·塔兰特（Guy Tarrant）  没收 了来自儿童的许多物品。他说：“有很多东西，有很多  时尚 和舞台。我在150多家学校担任过补习老师，所以我可能已经看到了。”

可以说，烦躁不安的人不一定总是这个月的风度  。最终，它们将被限制在垃圾箱中，取而代之的是同样令人上瘾且令人讨厌的新热潮。
