It happened 100 years ago this week: tired young men jumped out of their muddy trenches on the Western Front of the First World War and fraternized with the enemy. Soldiers exchanged small gifts and some even played football together in no-man's-land.

This extraordinary event, which came to be known as The Christmas Truce, took place between British and German troops. Michael Jurgs, the author of The Small Peace in the Great War, says there wasmuch more to this spontaneous ceasefire than just the Christmas spirit. The historian believes soldiers of both sides were simply fed up with the war.

Jurgs says the soldiers had been promised they would be home by Christmas, but after a few months of war, there were already a million dead and there was no sign the conflict would end any day soon. The bad weather made everybody even more miserable. The first move towards the truce came from the German side. Jurgs is from Germany and he finds this surprising because hiscountry "has started or joined many wars" - but the German soldiers began to sing the Christmas carol, 'Silent Night, Holy Night' and that's how it all began.

The tune helped to break the ice, because it was recognised by the British and the news spread quickly along the trenches.
Captain G.B. Jameson of the Northumberland HussarsYeomanry was there when it happened. He remembered, during an interview in 1991, that a comrade told him that some German soldiers were walking outside the trenches. He thought his friend was joking but it turned out to be true. Jameson said that nobody was fighting and people were just wandering around the top talking, having a great time.

The soldiers chatted, smoked, exchanged gifts and even played football together in no-man's-land. But the truce was never going to last. The high command placed a ban on this type of behaviour, and, in spite of some isolated outbreaks of goodwill the following year, it was not repeated.
It sounds like a good Christmas story for amovie but... it's good to remember: it really did happen. Merry Christmas!

它发生在100年前的本周：疲惫的年轻人从第一次世界大战西部战线的泥泞地沟中跳出来，与敌人结为伙伴。士兵们交换了一些小礼物，有些甚至在无人区里一起踢了足球。

这场非同寻常的事件被称为“圣诞节休战”，发生在英德两国军队之间。《大战中的小和平》的作者迈克尔·乔格斯（Michael Jurgs）说，自发的停火不仅有圣诞节精神，还有很多。历史学家认为，双方的士兵简直厌倦了战争。

乔格斯说，曾经向士兵们保证过他们将在圣诞节前回家，但是经过几个月的战争，已经有一百万人丧生，而且没有迹象表明冲突很快就会结束。恶劣的天气使每个人都更加悲惨。走向停战的第一步来自德方。乔格斯来自德国，他发现这令人惊讶，因为他的国家“已经开始或参加了许多战争”，但是德国士兵开始唱圣诞颂歌“寂静的夜晚，神圣的夜晚”，这就是一切的开始。

这种曲调有助于打破僵局，因为它得到了英国人的认可，新闻迅速在战壕中传播。

诺森伯兰轻骑兵装甲部队的詹姆森上尉当时就在场。他记得在1991年的一次采访中，一位同志告诉他，一些德国士兵正在战es外行走。他以为他的朋友在开玩笑，但事实证明这是事实。詹姆森说，没有人在吵架，人们只是在闲逛中闲逛，玩得很开心。

士兵们在无人区聊天，抽烟，交换礼物，甚至一起踢足球。但是休战永远不会结束。最高司令部禁止这种行为，尽管来年尽管有一些善意暴发，却没有重复。

对于影视来说，这听起来像是一个很好的圣诞节故事，但是……要记住：这确实发生了。圣诞节快乐！
