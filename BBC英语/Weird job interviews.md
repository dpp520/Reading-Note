Finding a new job isn’t always easy. You search for a suitable vacancy, send in an application form and if that goes well, you might be invited for an interview. For some, this is when the panic sets in – you’re going to be faced by a panel of strangers who’ll fire difficult questions at you, and you’ll have to actually prove yourself. But how would you feel if, instead of being asked why you want the job, you’re asked to stand up and dance?!

From the perspective of a company, it wants to hire the right person because they can make a big difference to the success of the organisation. It therefore needs to test acandidate in the most appropriate way to discover how suitable he or she may be. A good interview process should involve rigorous screening of job applicants and effective questions that every applicant gets asked. But that’s not always the case.

Alison Green is an author and creator of the workplace advice column 'Ask a Manager'. She told the BBC that some companies “give their interviewers little or no training and often leave them completely on their own when it comes to figuring out what to ask job candidates.” She mentions that some interviewers are too casual and some focus on building a good rapport and end up hiring the candidate they just ‘clicked with’, regardless of their skills and abilities.

An inexperienced interviewer may think it’s clever to ask ‘if you were an animal, what kind would you be?’ That has been asked, Alison Green says, but in reality this has no connection with the job. And there have been inappropriate requests, such as one job seeker being asked to show the interviewer the inside of her handbag to demonstrate how organised she was. Talking of inappropriate, the BBC heard from a number of people who were surprised by the questions they were asked in an interview. Mature student Kevin Helton said that "the interviewer asked, 'you used to be in the Army, how many people have you killed?'”

But as Alison Green points out, while a candidate might feel at the mercy of an interviewer, they are able to question why they’re being asked something, and while the interviewer might be making judgements, the candidate can also make their own judgement and decide if this is really the career move they want to make!

找新工作并不总是那么容易。您寻找合适的职位空缺，发送申请表，如果顺利的话，可能会邀请您进行面试。对于一些人来说，这是恐慌开始的时候，您将面对一群陌生人，他们将向您提出棘手的问题，而您实际上必须证明自己。但是，如果您被要求站起来跳舞，而不是被问到为什么要这份工作，您会感觉如何？

从公司的角度来看，它想雇用合适的人，因为他们可以对组织的成功产生重大影响。因此，它需要以最合适的方式测试候选人，以发现他或她可能有多合适。一个好的面试过程应包括对求职者的严格筛选和每位求职者都会被询问的有效问题。但这并非总是如此。

艾莉森·格林（Alison Green）是一名作家，也是职场建议专栏的、“问经理”的创建者。她告诉英国广播公司（BBC），有些公司给他们的面试官几乎没有培训，并且在弄清楚该问什么应聘者时常常完全让他们自己任凭自己。”她提到有些面试官太随意了，有些则专注于建立一个良好的关系，并最终聘请他们只是一拍即合的，不管他们的技能和能力。

一个没有经验的面试官可能会认为这是聪明的问“如果你是动物，你想成为什么样的？” 有人问过这个，艾莉森·格林说，但实际上，这与工作没有关系。而且有不适当的要求，例如要求一个求职者向面试官展示手提包的内部，以证明她的组织能力。谈到不当，英国广播公司从许多人那里听到，他们对采访中提出的问题感到惊讶。学生凯文·赫尔顿（Kevin Helton）说：“面试官问，'你曾经在部队服役，杀死了多少人？'"

但是，正如艾莉森·格林（Alison Green）指出的那样，虽然候选人可能会感到面试官的摆布，但他们能够质疑为什么要问他们一些事情，而当面试官可能做出判断时，候选人也可以做出自己的判断和决定这是否真的是他们想要采取的职业行动!
